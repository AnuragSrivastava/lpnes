%% Exercise 6.5
%%
%% Write a predicate swapfl(List1, List2) which checks whether List1 is
%% identical to List2, except that the first and last elements are
%% exchanged. Hereâ€™s where append/3 could come in useful again, but it is
%% also possible to write a recursive definition without appealing to
%% append/3 (or any other) predicates.

swapfl([H1|T1], [H2|T2]) :-
    reverse(T1, [H2|X]),
    reverse(T2, [H1|X]).
