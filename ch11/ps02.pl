%% Practical Session 11, Exercise 2
%%
%% Using the subset predicate you have just written, and findall/3 , write a
%% predicate powerset/2 that takes a set as its first argument, and returns
%% the powerset of this set as the second argument. (The powerset of a set
%% is the set of all its subsets.) For example:
%%
%% ?- powerset([a,b,c], P).
%%
%% should return
%%
%% P = [[],[a],[b],[c],[a,b],[a,c],[b,c],[a,b,c]]
%%
%% It doesnâ€™t matter if the sets are returned in some other order. For
%% example,
%%
%% P = [[a],[b],[c],[a,b,c],[],[a,b],[a,c],[b,c]]
%%
%% is fine too.
