# Learn Prolog Now! Exercise Solutions

*Please note that this work is in progress.*

This is a collection of solutions to exercises found in Learn Prolog Now!
textbook by Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and Kristina Striegnitz.

The book is available online:

http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=online

However, the authors forgot to include solutions to exercises into the free
version of the book, so this my effort is to correct the mistake.

## Other solutions

I know that paper version of the book contains the solutions, but I don't
have it and cannot check my solutions.

I also know that there is a blog post that has link to zip archive that
supposedly contain solutions as well. 'Anyone is welcome to use them for
self-checking' - its author says. However, these files are in proprietary,
secret `.doc` format, so I took that as a personal offense.

There is [this repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/dragonwasrobot/learn-prolog-now-exercises). Initially
I thought that it's a good collection of solutions. Then I actually read
them and concluded that programming skill the author is insufficient. Then I
opened [an
issue](https://github.com/dragonwasrobot/learn-prolog-now-exercises/issues/4)
to point out that his solutions have flaws. It was ignored.

Thus, I shall write my own solutions.
